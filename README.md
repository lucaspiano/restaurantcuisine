# restaurantcuisine
Restaurant Cuisine is a very small application made in Kotlin that searches some restaurants following some criteria like customer rate, distance, price, cuisine specialty, etc and gives the best result based on this search criteria with the data input by the user.

This application just lists some restaurants based on the criteria search established by the user like Restaurant Name, Customer Rating, Price, Distance and Cuisine available.

The application was primarily written in Kotlin using the concept of OOP and MVC patterns together with some more modern approach very much used for microservices like Repository and Service layers.

The files to be read "cuisines.cvs" and "restaurants.cvs" should be placed somewhere locally on the user's machine and this file path should be updated on Service Layer where file path is shown.

Some changes should be made later on like - placing the right access level to variables like private, internal, etc as they're still with their standard access.
